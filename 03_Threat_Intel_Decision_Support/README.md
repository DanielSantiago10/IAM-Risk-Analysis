# Cyber Threat Intelligence & Decision Support Framework

## 📌 Project Overview
In this framework, I developed a decision-making model to identify, characterize, and respond to various threat actors. The project focuses on translating raw threat data into actionable defense strategies for organizational leadership.

## 🕵️ Threat Actor Profiling
I analyzed and categorized threat actors based on their motivations and technical capabilities. This includes distinguishing between unintentional insiders (negligence) and sophisticated external actors (cyber gangs).

## 🛡️ Strategic Response & MITRE ATT&CK® Mapping
A key component of this project was mapping defensive strategies to the `MITRE ATT&CK® Framework`. By identifying specific techniques, such as `Domain Policy Modification (T1484)`, I developed proactive and reactive controls to secure company assets.

### **Key Strategies:**
* **Detection Best Practices:** Implementing awareness programs (posters, newsletters) to teach security objectives and trends.
* **Proactive Defense:** Training individuals on policy before incidents occur and monitoring for success/failure metrics.
* **Asset Protection:** Identifying high-value targets in financial and healthcare sectors, such as PII, SSN, and account numbers.

## 💡 Technical Insight: The "Why"
I focused on 'Individuals not following policy' because human uncertainty and lack of knowledge are often the primary drivers of security incidents. By building a culture in which the 'why' is explained alongside the 'how,' we create a more resilient organization in which employees are held accountable through close monitoring and continuous training.
