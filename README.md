# Identity Management & Security Governance Frameworks

This repository showcases a strategic approach to organizational security, focusing on **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, **Risk Mitigation**, and **Security Governance**.

## 🛠️ Project Components

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Matrix
Designed a comprehensive access control strategy to enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**. 
* **Key Work:** Developed a granular matrix mapping user roles to specific permissions (View, Create, Modify, Delete) to prevent lateral movement within a network.

### 2. Risk Mitigation & Case Studies
Analyzed real-world security breaches to identify gaps caused by human factors and technical failures.
* **Key Work:** Developed defense-in-depth strategies including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation, sandboxing, and automated network monitoring.

### 3. Threat Characterization & Decision Support
Created a **Decision Aid framework** to help leadership categorize threat actors and prioritize security responses.
* **Key Work:** Researched threat actor motivations and mapped defensive tactics to the **MITRE ATT&CK®** framework.

## 🛡️ Core Competencies Demonstrated
* **IAM:** Access Control Lists (ACLs) & RBAC.
* **GRC:** Policy development and regulatory compliance.
* **Threat Intel:** Categorizing threat actors and calculating organizational risk.
* **Technical Writing:** Producing professional-grade security reports and decision aids.
