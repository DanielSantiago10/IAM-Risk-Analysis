## 🛠️ Key Project Components

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Matrix

Designed a comprehensive access control strategy to enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**.

* **Key Work:** Developed a granular matrix mapping user roles to specific permissions (View, Create, Modify, Delete) to prevent lateral movement.

### 2. Risk Mitigation & Defense-in-Depth

Analyzed security breaches to identify gaps caused by human factors and technical failures.

* **Key Work:** Developed layered strategies including MFA implementation, email sandboxing, and session-locking to secure the physical-to-digital perimeter.

### 3. Threat Characterization & Decision Support

Created a **Decision Aid framework** to help leadership categorize threat actors and prioritize responses.

* **Key Work:** Researched threat actor motivations and mapped defensive tactics directly to the **MITRE ATT&CK®** framework.

## 🛡️ Core Competencies Demonstrated

* **IAM:** Access Control Lists (ACLs) & RBAC implementation.
* **GRC:** Security policy development and regulatory compliance (Legal perspectives).
* **Threat Intel:** Actor profiling and mapping techniques to industry-standard frameworks.
* **Strategic Planning:** Transitioning organizations from a reactive to a proactive security posture.
