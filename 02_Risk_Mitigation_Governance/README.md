# Security Awareness & Enterprise Risk Mitigation Strategy

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involved a comprehensive risk assessment and high-level security audit for "Fizza Cola" following a multi-vector breach involving social engineering and physical security failures. I analyzed how human factors—such as responding to phishing emails, failing to lock workstations, or improper PII storage—can lead to catastrophic financial loss and business closure.

## 🛡️ Strategic Framework: Proactive Defense-in-Depth

I advocated for a fundamental shift from a **reactive** to a **proactive** mindset to "beat the enemy to the punch". By identifying vulnerabilities before exploitation, I developed a mitigation roadmap based on the principle of **Layering**.

## 📊 Key Deliverables

### 1. Mandatory Security Awareness Program

To address undefined training frequencies, I developed a structured roadmap to transform employees into a "Human Firewall":

* **Onboarding Integration:** Mandatory security training for all new hires within their first 60 days.


* **Deployment Timeline:** A phased rollout targeting 50% staff completion within 30 days and 100% within 60 days.


* **Continuous Education:** Implementation of annual refreshers to maintain a security-first culture.



### 2. 10-Point Security Enforcement Framework

I established a high-priority checklist to reduce the organization's "Trust Surface" and ensure data integrity:

* **Technical Hardening:** Deploying updated antivirus, flagging external emails, and addressing Zero-day exploits.


* **Data Governance:** Information classification, handling, and labeling.


* **Physical & Behavioral Controls:** Enforcement of "Clean Desk" policies, workstation session-locking, and tailgating prevention.

## 💡 Technical Insight: The Cost of Negligence

From a legal perspective, failing to address these security gaps is catastrophic. Negligence in protecting client and employee information leads to lawsuits, bad publicity, and irreparable reputation damage. My strategy transforms employees from the 'weakest link' into a 'proactive sensor' that reports irregularities, effectively creating a containment plan for threats like phishing.
